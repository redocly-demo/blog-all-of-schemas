# Example of extending schemas with `allOf`

This repository accompanies the blog post about [extending schemas with `allOf`](https://redocly.com/blog/all-of-schemas/).

It is intentionally minimalist.

The try it and code samples interact with [mock servers](https://redocly.com/docs/api-registry/guides/mock-server-quickstart/).
